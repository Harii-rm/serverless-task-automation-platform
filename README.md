Serverless Task Automation Platform

Project Overview:

    The Serverless Task Automation Platform is a lightweight event-driven system that allows users to automate tasks using triggers such as time-based schedules or API events. The platform simplifies automation workflows by enabling users to define rules consisting of triggers and actions without managing complex infrastructure.

Problem It Solves:

    Many automation platforms are expensive, complex, or designed for enterprise use. Students and small developers need a simple, free, and easy-to-use automation solution to schedule tasks, trigger workflows, and monitor executions efficiently.

Target Users (Personas):

    Student Developer

    Needs simple automation for projects

    Limited cloud experience

    Prefers free tools

    Small Team Developer

    Automates repetitive tasks

    Needs monitoring and logs

    Requires lightweight deployment

Vision Statement:

    To provide an easy-to-use, free, and scalable automation platform that enables users to build event-driven workflows with minimal setup and maximum reliability.

Key Features / Goals:

    Rule-based automation creation

    Time-based and API-based triggers

    Automatic task execution

    Execution logging and monitoring

    Web-based dashboard

Success Metrics:

    Users can create automation rules successfully

    Task execution success rate above 90%

    System uptime during testing phase

    Positive usability feedback

Assumptions & Constraints:
